            <p class="biography-text">
                Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda was a Filipino nationalist, physician, and writer whose works and activism played a crucial role in the Philippines' movement for independence from Spanish colonization.
            </p>
            <p class="biography-text">
                A brilliant student from an early age, Rizal attended the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and later the University of Santo Tomas. His thirst for knowledge led him to Europe, where he continued his studies in medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid and specialized in ophthalmology in Paris and Heidelberg.
            </p>
            <p class="biography-text">
                But Rizal was far more than just a doctor. He was a polymath who spoke over 20 languages, practiced sculpture and painting, studied anthropology and ethnography, and excelled as a poet, essayist, and novelist. His most famous works—<i>Noli Me Tángere</i> (Touch Me Not) and <i>El Filibusterismo</i> (The Subversive)—exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule and inspired a growing sense of national identity among Filipinos.
            </p>
            <p class="biography-text">
                Rizal's advocacy for peaceful reform rather than violent revolution made him a target of Spanish authorities. Despite living in voluntary exile in Europe for much of his adult life, he returned to the Philippines in 1892 and founded the civic organization La Liga Filipina, which advocated for reforms through peaceful means.
            </p>
            <p class="biography-text">
                Shortly after establishing La Liga, Rizal was arrested and exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao, where he spent four years teaching, conducting scientific research, and providing free medical care to the community. Even in exile, his impact continued to grow.
            </p>
            <p class="biography-text">
                In 1896, as the Philippine Revolution erupted, Rizal was implicated in the rebellion despite his advocacy for peaceful reform. He was arrested en route to Cuba, where he had volunteered to serve as a doctor during a yellow fever epidemic. After a mock trial, he was convicted of rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy.
            </p>
            <p class="biography-text">
                On December 30, 1896, at the age of 35, Jose Rizal was executed by firing squad at Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park) in Manila. The night before his execution, he wrote "Mi Último Adiós" (My Last Farewell), a powerful final testament to his love for the Philippines. His execution made him a martyr for the cause of Filipino freedom and galvanized the revolutionary movement.
            </p>
            <p class="biography-text">
                Rizal's legacy extends far beyond his martyrdom. His writings awakened Filipino national consciousness and laid the intellectual foundation for the Philippine Revolution. More than a century after his death, Rizal remains a symbol of Filipino nationalism, intellectual excellence, and moral courage in the face of oppression.
