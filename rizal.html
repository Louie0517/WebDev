    <p class="biography-text">
        Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda was the seventh of eleven children of Francisco Mercado and Teodora Alonso. His family was well-off and educated, which provided Rizal the opportunity to pursue learning early in life. His mother was his first teacher, instilling in him a deep love for reading and literature.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        A prodigy with a keen mind, Rizal learned the alphabet at age three and could read and write by the age of five. He entered the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he graduated with highest honors, and pursued further studies at the University of Santo Tomas. Dissatisfied with the educational system and racial discrimination in the Philippines, he moved to Europe in 1882 to further his education.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        Rizal studied medicine and philosophy at the Universidad Central de Madrid and earned his licentiate in medicine. He later trained as an ophthalmologist in Paris and Heidelberg to treat his mother’s failing eyesight. He was deeply inspired by European liberalism, the Enlightenment, and the writings of thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Schiller.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        Besides being a physician, Rizal was a linguist, sculptor, painter, historian, ethnographer, and educator. He spoke over 20 languages including Tagalog, Spanish, German, French, Latin, and Japanese. He also championed education as a tool for empowering Filipinos and promoting social change.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        In 1887, Rizal published his first novel, <i>Noli Me Tángere</i> (Touch Me Not), which exposed the abuses of the Spanish friars and clergy. This was followed by <i>El Filibusterismo</i> (The Reign of Greed) in 1891, a darker and more revolutionary sequel that criticized the corrupt colonial government and inspired Filipinos to demand reform and equality.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        His writings were banned in the Philippines, but they spread underground and fueled nationalist sentiment. He founded La Liga Filipina in 1892 upon his return, aiming to unite Filipinos in peaceful civic reform. This act led to his arrest and exile to Dapitan, where he lived from 1892 to 1896.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        While in Dapitan, Rizal lived a productive life—establishing a school, constructing a water system, practicing medicine, and conducting botanical and anthropological studies. He also maintained correspondence with fellow reformists and foreign scientists.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        In 1896, the Philippine Revolution broke out. Although he did not advocate violence, Rizal was implicated due to his influence on the revolutionary spirit. En route to Cuba to serve as a volunteer doctor, he was arrested, brought back to the Philippines, and subjected to a military trial.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        On December 30, 1896, at dawn, Rizal was executed at Bagumbayan (now Rizal Park) by a Spanish firing squad. His final poem, <i>Mi Último Adiós</i> (My Last Farewell), written the night before his death, became a timeless piece of Filipino literature expressing his love for his country and his acceptance of martyrdom.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        José Rizal's death became the spark that intensified the revolutionary efforts against Spanish rule. Today, he is remembered as the national hero of the Philippines, a symbol of peaceful resistance, intellectual excellence, and civic responsibility. His life and works continue to be taught in schools and commemorated every December 30, known as Rizal Day.
    </p>
    <p class="biography-text">
        His legacy lives on through numerous monuments, books, educational institutions, and the continued fight for justice and dignity in Filipino society. He remains a figure who inspires Filipinos to rise against oppression through education, moral integrity, and love for the nation.
